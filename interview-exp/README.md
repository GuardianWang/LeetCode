# Tricks

1. [stars and bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics))
2. [binary index tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbafSgetDDk) 
- idx starts from 1
- update: idx += idx & -idx
- query: idx -= idx & -idx
3. bisect: think of arr = [0, 1]
- `bisect_right(arr, 0) == 1`
- `bisect_left(arr, 0) == 0`
- `max(bisect_right(arr, v) - 1, 0)` closest value <= v
- `min(bisect_left(arr, v), len(arr) - 1)` closest value >= v
4. `min(generator, default=v)` default
5. `(i for i in range(3))` in `()` is a generator
