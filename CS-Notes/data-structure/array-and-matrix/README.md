## Pattern

- array or matrix

## Types

- find subarray/subsequence w/ some property
- find missing/duplicate values
- find target in sorted matrix
- modify the array to satisfy some property
- use value as index of the next value: must form a loop

## Tricks

- for 2D matrix finding element, start from lower left/upper right
- when values are integers within index range, look on array as linked list, and values are next indices
- all(), any()
- use array to mark visited
- use `if n is not None` instead of `if n` when n >= 0
