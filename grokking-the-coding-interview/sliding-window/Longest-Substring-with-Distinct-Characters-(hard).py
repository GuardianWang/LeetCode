LC 3
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring, which has all distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: String="aabccbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring with distinct characters is "abc".
Example 2:

Input: String="abbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with distinct characters is "ab".
Example 3:

Input: String="abccde"
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest substrings with distinct characters are "abc" & "cde".
