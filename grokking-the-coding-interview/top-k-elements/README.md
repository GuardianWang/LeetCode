## Pattern

- max/min k values

## Pipeline

- maintain a min heap for max k values or 
maintain a max heap for min k values

## Types

1. top k values
1. arrange letters: also maintain a deque of letters to be pushed to heap

## Tricks

- quickselect/partition
- to sort by **frequency**, use bucket sort to have O(N) time 
- [collections.Counter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) Note: this is sorted, so O(NlogN) time by default
- push a tuple to the heap to sort by multiple keys
