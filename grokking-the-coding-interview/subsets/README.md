## Pattern

- solution can be built recursively

## Pipeline

- Find the relationship between f(n) and f(n - 1)
- Build solution by
  1. using all nodes in the tree
  1. using leaves in the tree
  1. using dp and solution to sub-problems

### all nodes
```python
res = [init]
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(len(res)):
    res.append(f(res[j]))
```

### leaves
```python
from collections import deque
res = deque([init])
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(len(res)):
    res.append(f(res.popleft()))
```

### dp
```python
dp[i] = f(dp[0], ..., dp[i - 1])
```

## Types

1. All nodes
1. leaves
1. dp


## Tricks

- the n-th Catalan number is bounded by 4^n / (n sqrt(n))
- C1 = 1, Cn+1 = ((4n + 2) / (n + 2)) Cn
