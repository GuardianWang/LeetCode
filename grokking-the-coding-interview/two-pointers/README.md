# Two Pointers

## Problems

## Pattern

- sorted array
- compare two arrays
- in-place reconstruction of an array

## Pipeline

1. decide the start/end point
2. move pointers

## Types

1. k sum: deduce to 2 sum
2. in-place reconstruction: one ptr indicates the index to put new item,
   another ptr to iterate the array
3. find a sub-structure: sometimes similar to sliding window, can also shrink two pointers starting from both ends

## Tricks

- freedom of direction: pointers can go from left to right/right to left/center to ends/ends to center
