## Pattern

- tree
- depth/level order
- connect siblings

## Pipeline

### traverse level by length
```python
from collections import deque


if not root:
	return None
level = deque([root])
while level:
	l = len(level)  # size of a level
	# traverse a level
	for i in range(l):
		node = level.popleft()
		if i == 0:
			# the first in this level
		if i == l - 1:
			# the last in this level
		if node.left:
			level.append(node.left)
		if node.right:
			level.append(node.right)

```

### traverse next level in O(1) space with sibling pointer
```python
if not root:
	return None
# `start` and `end` are two side nodes in the same level
start = root
end = root
while start:
	it = iter_next_level(start)
	left_sibling = next(it, None)
	next_level_start = left_sibling

	right_sibling = None
	for right_sibling in it:
		left_sibling.next = right_sibling
		left_sibling = right_sibling
	# `left_sibling becomes the end node in the next level
	# `right_sibling may not because it can be None even if next level is not empty (e.g., only 1 node in the next level)
	end.next = next_level_start  # `next_end` is at the same level as `start`

	start, end = next_level_start, left_sibling

	return root


def iter_next_level(node):
	# node is the start of a level
	while node:
		if node.left:
			yield node.left
		if node.right:
			yield node.right
		node = node.next
```

## Types

1. traversal order by depth: count depth
1. smallest/largest depth: count depth
1. level statistics: keep level nodes
1. siblings: use iterator

## Tricks

- use iterator for sibling traversal
